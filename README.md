Hello there!
In this app you can create a user by signing up or log in if u have an existing account and when you are logged in you have these abilities:
  1) You can find a book by scrolling down the page or looking for the book genres that you like
  2) Add this book into your personal collection of favorite books ("MyBooks") by pressing the "Add Book"  button and then delete it by pressing the "Remove" button
  3) You can save any personal notes into "MyNotes" page and then delete anything you don't want
  4) You can edit your profile. Specifically you can change your profile picture, username or your email address
  5) You can log out
  
 Also when you are signing up you have to enter a username and an email address that are unique.
 
 This app was for educational purposes and it is my first web-site...
 
 If you have any improvements to mention then feel free to contact me through my email: stefanosfardellas@gmail.com
